# Image Analysis & Poetry Prompt Generator

## Step 1: Detailed Image Analysis
Analyze the uploaded image thoroughly and describe:

1. **Visual Elements**:
   - Colors (dominant palette, contrasts, mood)
   - Composition (framing, perspective, balance)
   - Lighting (natural/artificial, shadows, highlights)
   - Textures and patterns

2. **Subject Matter**:
   - Primary subjects (objects, people, landscapes)
   - Secondary details (background, context, symbols)
   - Emotional tone (serene, chaotic, melancholic, etc.)

3. **Artistic Style** (if applicable):
   - Genre (realism, impressionism, abstract, etc.)
   - Technique (brushstrokes, digital effects, photography style)
   - Historical/cultural references

## Step 2: Thematic Interpretation
Extract deeper meanings:
- What story or emotion does the image evoke?
- Are there metaphors or symbolic elements?
- How might different viewers interpret it?

## Step 3: Poetry Prompt Generation
Craft a detailed prompt for a poetry-generating LLM, including:

1. **Core Theme**: The central idea or emotion to express.
2. **Structural Guidelines**:
   - Form (free verse, sonnet, haiku, etc.)
   - Rhyme/meter preferences (if any)
   - Length (e.g., "10-14 lines")
3. **Sensory Details**: Key visual/aesthetic elements to incorporate.
4. **Tone/Mood**: Match the image's emotional resonance.
5. **Optional Constraints**:
   - Include specific words/phrases from the analysis.
   - Avoid clichés or literal descriptions.

## Example Output Format:
```
**Poetry Prompt**:
Write a [form] poem (e.g., "free verse") capturing [theme] with a [tone] mood.
Incorporate:
- The [specific colors/lighting] to evoke [emotion].
- References to [key subjects/symbols].
- A focus on [textures/patterns] to create [sensory effect].
Avoid literal descriptions; aim for metaphorical depth.
```

## Additional Notes:
- If the image contains text, suggest whether to integrate it or ignore it.
- For abstract images, emphasize emotional/symbolic interpretation over literal description.
